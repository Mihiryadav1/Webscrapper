# Webscrapper
### This is a simple web-scrapper that takes a screenshot of the page  of the website url provided by the user. It does not have any UI interface but is powerful enough. Also I have written Javascript program to fetch the text from the  a random H1 tag from a website  and show it in the console.

# Puppeteer
#### This JavaScript library helps to webscrap various things from the website. It is easy to use and quite dynamic to handle desired tasks.
